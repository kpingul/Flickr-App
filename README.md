#The Goal

I created the Flickr App because I wanted to use <a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr's API</a> and create a 
slideshow of my uploaded photos.


#The Approach

In this project, I really wanted to get started working with real world API's. So, what did I do, I looked up at some useful API's and ran into <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>. Getting into this part of the web was totally foreign to me as to I didn't know how to approach it. Basically, I looked at the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr API</a> page and did some browsing and found a node module called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/flickr">Flickr-API</a> and got it setup(Customer ID/Token) for me to send a request to the Flickr servers. From that point on, once I got the data back as JSON, the fun was going to start. In fact, instead of using a templating library, I just created a basic algorithm to serve up the data I needed to append the Images to the page. Long story short, working with the Flickr API really challenged me to learn outside of my realm and taught me a lot.

#The Build

<a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> for the UI

<a href="https://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-Image-Gallery">Jquery + Image Gallery Plugin</a> for the slideshow and modal.

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/flickrapi">Flickr wrapper with oAuth authentication</a> for serving up the API.
